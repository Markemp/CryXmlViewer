# CryXmlViewer

This VS Code extension allows you to view binary XML files from Cryengine games and other sources.  The most common of these are the material files for newer Star Citizen source files, but other Cryengine games may also use this format.  You can tell if a file is compatible as it will start with the magic string of either `CryXmlB` or `pbxml`.

## Features

This is a simple binary xml viewer that can read CryXml and pbxml files.
